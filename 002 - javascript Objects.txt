#Java script Object

1. In JavaScript, objects are data structures similar to Array, representing collections of key-value pairs. 

example:
{
  firstName:"Josy",  //"firstName" is key & "Josy" is value
  lastName:"Alexis", 
  age:35, 
  eyeColor:"brown"
}




2. They can hold various data types, including functions, arrays, and other objects. 

example:
{
  firstName:"Josy",                                               //Datatype of "Josy" is String
  lastName:"Alexis",                                              //Datatype of "Alexis" is String
  age:35,                                                         //Datatype of 35 is Number
  married:"True",                                                 //Datatype of True is Boolean
  booksReaded:['The miracle morning', 'Only one Think']           //Datatype of is Array
  brother:{                                                       //Object
    firstName:'Jerry',
    lastName:'Xavier'
  }
}



3. Internally, objects are stored as dynamic, unordered properties, optimized for flexibility. This allows for dynamic manipulation and efficient retrieval, making objects a cornerstone of JavaScript programming.
